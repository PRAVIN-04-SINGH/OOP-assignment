        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, making it a popular programming paradigm for building complex and scalable systems. Here are its key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity: OOP organizes code into classes and objects, making it easier to understand, manage, and modify. Changes in one part of the program typically don't affect the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code Reusability: Through features like inheritance, OOP allows you to reuse existing code for new functionalities. This reduces development time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability: OOP is designed to handle complexity. It allows developers to build scalable programs that can grow without becoming unmanageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation: By bundling data and methods together, OOP ensures that objects manage their own state, reducing the risk of unintended interference. This leads to more secure and reliable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Extensibility: OOP supports polymorphism and dynamic binding, making it easy to extend programs without rewriting existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy Maintenance: OOP-based programs are structured in a way that makes troubleshooting and maintenance much simpler. Bugs can often be fixed by isolating the affected class or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Real-world Mapping: OOP mirrors the real world by modeling data as objects with attributes and behaviors. This makes program design more intuitive and relatable."
